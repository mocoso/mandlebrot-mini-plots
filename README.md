# Mandlebrot mini plots

I think that Corey Chiverâ€™s [Mandlebrot
Orbits](https://github.com/cjbayesian/datascience-utils/blob/master/Mandelbrot_orbits.ipynb),
which plot how the series develop from particular points, are a really
interesting way to visualize the Mandlebrot set.

This is a version of them written in Javascript to make them easy to explore in your browser.

You can see it running at

Enjoy.
